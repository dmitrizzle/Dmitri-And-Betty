<h1>Things to do in/around Chiang Mai</h1>
<section>
	<p>There are a lot of fun things you can do here. Most of those things are very affordable (as opposed to "tour packages" you'd be offered by your hotel). This is a short list of stuff we personally recommend for you to try while visiting the cultural capital of Thailand.</p>

	<h2 id="inchiangmai">Things to do in Chiang Mai</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Temples:</strong> Thailand, especially Northern Thailand is a Buddhist temple mecca. There are so many of them in Chiang Mai, locals use them as landmarks to navigate the city; instead of a major interception you may often hear "Meet me by Wat Lamchang".</li>
		<li><strong>Cooking classes:</strong> There's a lot more to Thai food than Pad Thai. Most of it tastes and looks very different from what you may find in Canada - even in very good restaurants. So if you really want to take some of that delicious Massaman home, the best way is to learn how to make it yourself.</li>
		<li><strong>Thai massage:</strong> Massurs here tend to press hard on your sore spots. But it always makes you feel better after a while - especially after that long flight!</li>
		<li><strong>Sunday walking street:</strong> Perhaps the best place to get a souvenir is at the Sunday walking street market. Located west of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7t5t74M16dr" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tha Phae Gate</a> the event closes at least two major downtown streets. You can buy food, clothes, toys, decorations and random cool things. Arrive at early, around 5:00pm, to beat the crowd.</li>
		<li><strong>Bars:</strong> There's a nice little spot that's directly downstairs from our apartment we frequent. Other than that, there are at least a few very decent bars in downtown Chiang Mai. Another "bumpting" place we'd recommend is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/oqNk112J1N22" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warm Up Cafe</a> club - they have live bands almost every night, tends to have lots of people. Finally, if you are into jazz, check out <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/hkmPUFRdcDL2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The North Gate Jazz Club</a>. Drinks are generally very cheap and locals do not expect tips. Note that all drinking establishments close by midnight and there's also <strong>no alcohol sold between 2pm and 5pm</strong>.</li>
		<li><strong id="coffee">Cafes:</strong> Chiang Mai is a coffee heaven: locally grown beans, expertly brewed or pressed at a right price. <strong>NEVER visit Starbucks</strong>.</li>
			<li class="sublist"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9gt62rVG1xL2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">9th Street Cafe</a> is our personal favourite: fast internet, beautiful interior, friendly staff and incredible lattes.</li>
			<li class="sublist"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/6kKtPTwWYW82" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Into the Woods</a> is another great place that's decorated like a children's fairytale and even has a mini-library inside.</li>
			<li class="sublist"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/2q7nnpgqg4B2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Klom Cafe</a>: our local favorite. The lady who owns the place is an artist and it shows; also their lattes are excellent and very cheap.</li>
			<li class="sublist"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9ct7AstPpNn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mont Jo</a>: as recommended by our friend Lewis, has some of the best coffee in town. A bit of a ride but the owner has apparently got a very expensive espresso machine, he teaches new coffee shop owners how to make really good coffee and has two adorable dogs.</li>
			<li class="sublist"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/2QLN8MKm9UR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Moat ladies"</a> - don't actually know the name of this place but they serve the cheapest (still very good) espresso-based beverages in town.</li>
			<li class="sublist"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8zYfqWviP252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Local Cafe</a> beautiful interior: check, great coffee: check, wonderful deserts: check, very happening neighbourhood: check!</li>

	<h2 id="outsidechiangmai">Things to do outside of Chiang Mai</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Elephant Camp:</strong> This is the only tour that we've done in Chiang Mai. It's usually a day tour where you get to feed, ride, bathe, and "train" elephants with lunch included. It's very touristy but if you want to go on an elephant tour, Chiang Mai is the place to do it. You can book the tour with any tourist agency in Chiang Mai. They ALL sell it. The price, as always, is always negotiable.<br>I (Betty) went on the tour with Woody Elephant Training twice. The first time was magical. The second time was meh. The elephants are kind of jaded. They don't care about the people anymore. All they care about it the bananas. ;P</li>
		<li><strong>Bua Thong Waterfall:</strong> AKA "Sticky Waterfall". The reason it's called that way is because the bottom of the river is made of a material that resembles skateboard grip tape on touch. It's totally natural and is stunningly beautiful, plus you can climb it (but do be careful during the rain season).</li>
		<li><strong>Doi Suthep:</strong> There's a temple located at the top of the mountain that you can never miss if you are in Chiang Mai. You obviously have to go. But there is more than just the temple up in Suthep National Park. If you keep driving, you can find villages that grow coffee; in February there's a park where cherry blossoms bloom. And the place where Dmitri proposed to Betty is somewhere in there as well.</li>
		<li><strong>Doi Inthanon:</strong> Tallest mountain in Thailand. It will be colder with elevation so bring a change of clothes that's a bit warmer than usual. It's a bit of a drive.</li>
		<li><strong>House Boat:</strong> Eakachai Houseboat is a floating restaurant in Mae Ngat Dam. The Dam is big, beautiful, and surrounded by mountains. The water is not crystal clear but it doesn't look to bad to swim in. It's pretty expensive by Thai standards: 600 Baht for the boat ride plus another 150 Baht to enter the park. The price for food and beer at the restaurant is pretty reasonable. You also have an option of staying overnight in one of the floating huts. It's in the same vicinity as Bua Thong Waterfall so you can make it a day trip.</li>
		<li><strong>Huay Tung Tao:</strong> It's great place to spend the afternoon if you are feeling lazy. Huay Tung Tao is a lake about 30 minutes drive from the old city. You can hike or cycle around the lake but we prefer to chill in one of the bamboo huts right above the water. You can order food and beers from the restaurant close by and take a dip when you feel hot.
</li>
		<li><strong>Chiang Mai Quarry:</strong> A huge hole in a ground that was built for mining purposes. But something happened and now it's filled with water, featuring mini cliffs that you can jump off to prove you ain't afraid. Gets a bit touristy during peak hours though.</li>

	<h2 id="inchiangdao">Things to do in Chiang Dao</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Chiang Dao Cave:</strong> Explore the cave while getting ready for our wedding ceremony. There are some bats, lots of limestone, darkness and even a temple right inside. The guide will ask you for around 100 baht for the service.</li>
		<li><strong>The temple:</strong> Perhaps one of the most beautiful walks in Chiang Dao is a few hundred steps up a mountain side towards the temple that gives you an unforgettable overview of tropical mountains. Don't miss this trip!</li>

	<ul>
		<li><strong id="curry">Curry:</strong> The below two dishes are our favourites since they felt quite unique and especially delicious. But Thailand has a huge variety of curry dishes so don't stop there if you want more. <a href="#food">Go back to "things to eat" (above)</a>.</li>
			<li class="sublist">"Massaman" is a delicious yellow curry that's cooked with chicken and potatoes. List most curries it could feel quite spicy for some, but it's never too bad (at least to our taste buds). Best to have it either with jasmine or white rice.</li>
			<li class="sublist">"Pnang" is another yellow curry yet it comes with a certain flavour, mostly due to peanuts and other spices in it. Our favourite place to get it is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5atiJzXpfjA2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Blue Sky restaurant</a>.</li>
		<li><strong id="soups">Soups:</strong> delicious and a bit healthier than curries. Do not leave Thailand before trying kao soi - it's more of a national dish than pad thai. <a href="#food">Go back to "things to eat" (above)</a>.</li>
			<li class="sublist">"Kao soi" is kind of like curry. But it's a soup, usually with chicken, crispy stuff, noodles and green garnish.</li>
			<li class="sublist">"Tom Yum" is perhaps the most famous soupy dish in Northern Thailand. It comes in many different flavours but it's usually a bit sour, spicy and often has ground pork and peanuts.</li>
			<li class="sublist">"Coconut soup" is usually white in color and is filled with delicious vegetables; often served with either chicken or pork.</li>
		<li><strong id="rice">Rice dishes:</strong> like most Asian cuisine, Thai dishes usually have rice somewhere. These particular dishes are all about rice. <a href="#food">Go back to "things to eat" (above)</a>.</li>
			<li class="sublist">"Issan food" - is a Northern Thai speciality menu. Our favourite place to have it is upstairs at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/4CqNP1N9zPJ2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Central Festival mall</a>. Did we mention that malls are really, really good in Chiang Mai?</li>
			<li class="sublist">"Hianese chicken and rice" is healthy and delicious. Usually served with a small bowl of sup, its main feature is a specific type of rice that it comes with.</li>
			<li class="sublist">"Pad kapao" is stir-fried pork with basil on top of rice. You can also ask for "kai dao" - which means "egg on top" as locals often do. Staple dish.</li>
			<li class="sublist">"Jok chicken" is a barbecue chicken cooked at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ZdPbp3yVFkQ2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jok Sompet restaurant</a>. It's amazing.</li>
			<li class="sublist">"Stewed pork leg" will melt in your mouth. One of the best places to get it is at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/NDjZLDeZUy72" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this stall</a> - you will recognize it by a lady wearing a red cowboy hat.</li>
		<li><strong id="salads">Salads:</strong> for the days when you want to de-grease and grab some light lunch. <a href="#food">Go back to "things to eat" (above)</a>.</li>
			<li class="sublist"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/owno4XCAbYH2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Salad Concept on Nimman St</a> - they may the crispiest most delicious salad we've tasted anywhere. You can also add thinks like sushi-grade raw tuna and salmon, bacon and more. Try dipping it into wasabi sauce or "norther Thai style" green mint sauce.</li>
			<li class="sublist">"Som tam" is often spicy green papaya salad. It's unlike most salads you have ever tried so it comes highly recommended.</li>
		
		<li><strong id="snacks">Snacks:</strong> "great with beers".</li>
			<li class="sublist">"Sticky rice" (with fried chicken, curry sausage or nam pik). Best way to get it is to go to a market and ask for "caw neaw" (Dmitri remembers it as "cow meaw"). 20 baht is usually more than enough for two people. You then can make little balls out of it with your hands and dip it in curry, have it with fried chicken or have it with little packets of spicy sauce called "nam pik".</li>
			<li class="sublist">"Chiang Mai sausage" is a sausage prepared with rice and fermented pork, it's very common and very delicious stall food. There's one place that serves a very special kind of that sausage made with glass noodles, it's right next to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5atiJzXpfjA2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Blue Sky restaurant</a> but he isn't there every day (usually weekdays around afternoon).</li>
			<li class="sublist">Various stick foods. There are just so many! Most common is probably a pork stick, it tastes sweet and delicious.</li>
			
		<li><strong id="desserts">Desserts:</strong> although Thailand is not particularly famous for their deserts, there are some things that we think you should really try. <a href="#food">Go back to "things to eat" (above)</a>.</li>
			 <li class="sublist">"Mango sticky rice" is a very Thai thing, also very popular in Bangkok. You can have it as breakfast food as it is a substantial meal in itself.</li>
			 <li class="sublist">"Rainbow crepe cake" - there are many delicious cakes and other sweet things that you can buy here, but this one takes the prize. Somehow it's just better and if you see one - get it.</li>
			 <li class="sublist">"Green bread thing" - we don't know what the actual name is for this desert. But you can usually get it at the stalls that sell spicy ginger drinks. They will steam the bread and you can dip it into sweet green sauce. One such stall is close to the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/NDjZLDeZUy72" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Pork Lady stall"</a>.</li>
			 <li class="sublist">Durian ice cream - you know if you are in Thailand you gotta try it. They also have durian milk shakes in some place. Even durian coffee and chips. Just go full durian - if you dare.</li>
		<li><strong id="fruits">Fruits:</strong> A short list of our favorites. You can google them if you don't know how they look. Note that most of these are seasonal.</li>
			<li class="sublist">Jackfruit.</li>
			<li class="sublist">Mangosteen.</li>
			<li class="sublist">Durian.</li>
			<li class="sublist">Rose apple.</li>
			<li class="sublist">Snake fruit.</li>
			<li class="sublist">Tamarind.</li>
			
		<li><strong id="drinks">Drinks:</strong> it could get quite hot on some days so water is your best friend. But for the times when you want to have something special check these out. <a href="#food">Go back to "things to eat" (above)</a>.</li>
			<li class="sublist">Fruit shakes - mostly good, mostly made with real fruits right in front of you. As for little or no sugar.</li>
			<li class="sublist">Fancy soy milk and fancy ginger drinks.</li>
			<li class="sublist">Thai tea - very interesting flavour, make sure to ask for little or no sugar.</li>
			<li class="sublist">Coffee (there's a whole <a href="#coffee">section (above)</a> dedicated to the best places to get it).</li>
			<li class="sublist">Random sugar drinks at 7/11 - some of our favourites are "Mansome" and "Kick-a-poo".</li>
			<li class="sublist">Beer: locally brewed are called Chang, Singha and Leo. There's also Beer Lao (ask for Dar) which is pretty good and is imported from Lao PDR. Note that they often bring you a glass of ice and a warm bottle of beer that you'd be pouring over the ice. Other places will serve it out of the fridge like usual - but do try it Thai style as well, just so you can say that you did.</li>
			<li class="sublist">Liquor: local stuff is Hong Tong (super cheap, gets worse as you drink more). "Black Blend" is a surprisingly smooth-tasting whiskey that you can get at Tesco shops. Note that all drinking establishments close by midnight and there's also <strong>no alcohol sold between 2pm and 5pm</strong></li>
