	<p>We use <a href="http://www.momondo.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Momondo</a> and <a href="http://www.skyscanner.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a> to book flights in Southeast Asia; they offer the best rates. <strong>It’s usually better to fly to Bangkok (BKK) and book a separate flight to Chiang Mai.</strong></p>
	<p>From Canada, you could fly directly to Chiang Mai, usually through China. These flights are run by some of the most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OsGV_-DcH0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">horrible</a> airlines on earth like China Eastern Airlines and Southern China Airlines.</p>

	<p><strong>Bus:</strong> There are day buses and overnight buses from Bangkok to Chiang Mai for around 500-800 baht. You can get tickets from your hotel or any of the numerous travel agencies around Bangkok. They tend to crank up the AC on the buses so make sure you bring warm clothes.</p>
	<p><strong>Flights:</strong> Flights from Bangkok to Chiang Mai generally depart from DMK. There are numerous flights per day. The cost is approximately 1000 baht. For flights within Thailand you may be able to get better rates going directly to Air Asia, Nok or Lion Air.</p>
	<p><strong>Bangkok Airports:</strong> There are two airports in Bangkok: <strong>BKK</strong> and <strong>DMK</strong>. BKK is the big international airport. DMK has mostly budget airlines that offers domestic flights and some flights to other Southeast Asian countries. The two airports are far apart. There is a free shuttle bus that connects them but it takes around 1 - 1.5 hours depending on the traffic.If you are transferring airports, make sure to schedule your flights accordingly.</p>

	<p><strong>Airport Taxi:</strong> Catch an airport taxi from the north side of the airport, near domestic arrivals. Talk to one of the ladies near the airport taxi counter. They’ll arrange a car for you and give you a price. The cost for airport taxis is around 100-300 baht, depending on how far you want to go. The vehicles are brand new and very clean.</p>
	<p><strong>Song Thaew (red truck):</strong> You can flag down a Song Thaew anywhere outside of the airport doors. Tell the driver where you are going and negotiate a price. It’s around 20-50 baht /person. I usually pay 40 baht. Don’t pay more than 60 baht per person. If the driver refuses to take you, just flag down a different truck. Song Thaew are like public buses so they might pick up other passengers on the way (and they will take longer way around).</p>
	<p><strong>Tuk Tuks:</strong> Don’t take a tuk tuk. They’re smelly. They’re uncomfortable. The driver will always try to rip you off. We hate them.</strong>

	<p>We will arrange some shuttle buses going to the wedding venue. More details closer to the wedding date.</p>
	<p>If you are feeling brave, you can rent a car or motorcycle and drive there. You must have an international licence to rent a car in Chiang Mai. Anyone can rent a motorcycle but you might get stopped by traffic cops asking to check your licence. The fine is around 400 baht. It’s more time and cost efficient to bribe them.</p>
