# Dmitri-And-Betty
An open source project for our wedding invite website

I built this website using HTML, CSS3 and MooTools. See the [demo video](https://github.com/dmitrizzle/Dmitri-And-Betty/blob/master/demo.mov)
It integrates with JotForm also.
Note that in that demo video things seem a bit shaky. The blur effects do cost performance to the browsers, but in this case it's because I'm recording 2K video at the same time. Should work well on modern browsers and devices.
